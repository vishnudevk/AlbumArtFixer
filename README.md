## Contributing

Please submit issues and feature requests on GitHub.

Code contributions are welcomed in the form of [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). Please use the following code formatting and style guidelines:

* Tabs are 4 spaces in Java code and 2 spaces in XML
* 120 character line width

### Building with Maven

If you have Maven 3, the Android SDK and an ```ANDROID_HOME``` environment variable, you can simply build with:

    $mvn clean install
  
This expects an Android device to be attached for running instrumentation tests. Alternatively, use the ```-DskipTests``` option.

### IntelliJ project setup

Import as existing Maven project. Just works.

### Can I skip all this Maven stuff?

Yes. However, you'll need to look at the dependencies in the POMs and go hunting for the dependencies yourself.
